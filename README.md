# SimpleCorn

This mod aims to fill a few gaps in vanilla Minecraft by adding corn, integrated in a way that makes gameplay smooth and unchanged from the vanilla style.

## Features
* Corn kernels can be obtained from breaking grass at a slightly lower chance than seeds.
* Corn crops are 3 blocks tall, (comparable height to real life) and the growth stages are below:
* Ears of corn can be crafted into more kernels or cooked to produce a food meant to be comparable to a vegetarian counterpart to steak.
* Chowders add another use to milk that I feel is lacking in Minecraft.
* Corn fields also generate in villages and kernels are valid chicken tempting items!
* Craft a firework with kernels and it explodes into popcorn! Just for fun. :)
